# Introduction
- Spectroscopy: Info about atmosphere, nothing about the inside
- Something about how spectropscopy works? (Kartunnen)
- Atmospheres have been assuemed rep. of PCs (Witt)
- But there has been discussions about effects of atomic diffusion for a century (Chapman)
- Diffusion introduces errors, which make us make incorrect statements of past ISM. It is important that we find these errors since we will otherwise have a hard time doing a) chemical tagging and b) galactic archaeology, more specficially mapping the interstellar medium (ISM) (Dotter 2017)
- A method: Compare two stars where one is affected by atomic diffusion and the other isn't. Prefer old, metal poor stars as these should be affected more by the diffusion.
    * Korn has observed stars in globular clusters, compared them and found such errors.
    * In this project we attempt to find stars outside of globular clusters, instead we focus on stars that move together (binaries or wide binaries, hereafter called co-moving). These are constrained to be of same origin by having similar (but not exactly equal metallicity!) and lying on the same isochrone (Dotter 2016)
