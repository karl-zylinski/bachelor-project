When importing (from partial source with 1000 of 62000 csvs):

"Imported 21377664 stars
Skipped 5734839 because they lacked parallax"

Is it reasonable to cut out the ones that miss parallax? Seems to be 25% (5734839/21377664 = 0.268).

-------------

Comoving star in Gaia DR1 article says interesting things on cutting away parallax S/N ratio under a certain limit. Use this? Precomputed in dr2, could filter on it upon initial import
